my roommate is in a algorithms class, so I decided to do their work in
# Anything but java.

mostly due to religious differences between myself and eclipse.

> (theres a 18 step process to update modules that I didn't want, that fails, and it keeps annoying me about. also, I'm too poor to do InteliJ cuz working men don't get free copies. **@JetBrains** hit yo boy up).

node funzies on this one, look at the beautiful big arrow functions. *The module I used for blocking user input doesn't play nice with JS hoisting of the anonymous functions, or `cat data | node index.js` I'm just as sad as you are, but I don't care.*


to use it, follow the nonsense pdf, or do it the real logical way

1. enter a number (that's the number of lines you're going to "algorithm") and press enter
2. enter a series of numbers that follow the insane parameters of
    - the first digit is the number of digits in this line
    - a space
    - some amount of numbers separated by spaces
    - 2 more numbers that are the indexes of the numbers you want to add
    - hit enter
3. do that the amount of times you said in step 1.
